# Concha

The report covers more or less everything.


Main represents the code used for the main task. e.g. only 3 inputs and no API

Docker containers storing the code for main and opt-2 are located in my docker-hub account `twaitesjosh`


The commands:

` docker pull twaitesjosh/concha-main ` \ ` docker pull twaitesjosh/concha-opt2 ` 


` docker run -i twaitesjosh/concha-main `\ `docker run -i twaitesjosh/concha-opt2` 


will allow you access to the containers.
